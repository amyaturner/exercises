/* Without looking into your notes,
try to remember which primitive data types
are defined in JavaScript.
Then find this information on MDN.

ANSWER:
String
Number
Boolean
Undefined
Null
Symbol (haven't gone over)
There's another one, but can't remember

PROVIDED SOLUTION:
BigInt is the one I missed
Also, null is not capitalized even though all the others are (?)

Note from solution:
In addition to the primitive data types,
JavaScript has one non-primitive type: Object (which also comprises arrays).
The main difference is that values of
a primitive type are immutable. That is, there is no way
to change values like 47, 'Launch School', or true,
while you can change non-primitive values like arrays,
e.g. by adding or removing elements.
